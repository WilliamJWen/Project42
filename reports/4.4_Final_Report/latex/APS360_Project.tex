\section{Introduction}
The rise of hyper-realistic AI-generated images has eroded trust in digital media, enabling misinformation, deepfakes, and challenges to artistic authenticity. SynthLens, our project, aims to combat this by developing a robust deep learning model to detect AI-generated images. The goal is to create a tool that generalizes across evolving AI architectures (e.g., GANs, diffusion models) without frequent retraining, supporting journalists, social platforms, and users in verifying content authenticity.

Machine learning is critical because traditional methods fail to capture subtle artifacts produced by modern generators. Deep learning models excel at learning hierarchical features, making them uniquely suited to detect nuanced discrepancies. By leveraging multi-expert transfer learning, SynthLens combines global semantic understanding (via Vision Transformers) and local texture analysis (via EfficientNet), ensuring adaptability and high accuracy in a rapidly evolving landscape.

\section{Background \& Related Work}
\label{background}

Image synthesis is the process wherein an artificial image is generated by a computer from an input prompt, which may be text or some other form of media. This field exploded after the creation of GANs in 2014, a deep learning architecture particularly adept at generating photorealistic images \citep{GANfather}. More recently, DMs have also been a popular choice for image synthesis \citep{latent-diffusion}. While many attempts have been made to develop programs that can detect images generated by these architectures, they continually evolve to outsmart old detectors.

\subsection{Sightengine}

There are a number of AI-generated image detection websites which are free to use. One of these is \citet{sightengine}, which has a high accuracy rate compared to many other websites: approximately 99\% on real images and 81\% on AI-generated ones \citep{li2024adversarialaiartunderstandinggeneration}. However, it is far from foolproof. For example, when tested on images generated from image prompts by Dream Studio and DALL-E, its accuracy falls to only 34\%. Unlike the projects discussed below, Sightengine is not open-source.

\subsection{Beyond the Spectrum}

Beyond the Spectrum (BtS) is an open-source project focused on detecting images generated by GANs \citep{he2021spectrumdetectingdeepfakesresynthesis}.

Its method involves two stages. First, a re-synthesizer is trained only on real images to reconstruct images from their downsampled versions. Next, this re-synthesizer is given both real and fake images, and the reconstruction error, which is assumed to be greater for GAN-generated images, is given to a classifier to predict whether a given image is real or not.

In 2021, BtS achieved approxiately 90\% accuracy on its testing datasets and was state-of-the-art (SoTA). However, in 2024, after the progression of GAN models and the advent of DMs, BtS achieves only a 21\% accuracy rate \citep{li2024adversarialaiartunderstandinggeneration}. Nonetheless, its approach is echoed in more recent successful approaches, such as the zero-shot method discussed in \ref{ZED}.

\subsection{Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining}

Another architecture that has been explored for detecting AI-generated images is Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining (CLIP), which was developed by OpenAI in 2021 \citep{radford2021learningtransferablevisualmodels}. This model is trained on pairs of images and text, and in the context of AI-generated image detection, this text might either be their prompts or human-written descriptions. CLIP was used to achieve an accuracy of 95-100\%, making it a promising model for AI-generated image detection \citep{moskowitz2024detectingaigeneratedimagesclip}.

\subsection{Vision Transformers}

In natural language processing, text is interpreted as a sequence of tokens from which subsequent tokens can be predicted. Vision transformers (ViT) take a similar approach. Images are broken down into non-overlapping sections, like tokens, which are sent into an encoder comprised of multi-head attention and feed-forward neural networks. The output of the encoder is then passed into an MLP which classifies the image; in our case, it predicts whether the image is real or fake. In April 2024, researchers combined CLIP and ViT (CLIP-ViT) and were able to outperform a number of SoTA detection methods with an average accuracy of 90\% \citep{cozzolino2024raisingbaraigeneratedimage}.

\subsection{Zero-Shot Entropy-Based Detector}
\label{ZED}

The main issue in designing AI-generated image detectors is that image synthesis models are constantly evolving to circumvent detectors trained on old data. In September 2024, a new zero-shot method was devised which initially only trains on real images \citep{cozzolino2024zeroshotdetectionaigeneratedimages}. First, a CNN is trained to predict real images from encoded versions of those images. Next, the CNN is used to predict both real and fake images from their encoded versions, and loss statistics are used to differentiate real images from synthetic ones. This method was able to achieve an accuracy of 90\%, better than many other SoTA models.

\section{Data Processing}

\subsection{Dataset}

In order to ensure that our model would generalize well, we used data from a variety of sources. For real images, we sourced data from the ImageNet database test set \citep{5206848} and the Common Objects in Context (COCO) 2017 test dataset \citep{lin2015microsoft}. Both datasets contain a variety of semantic content in various contexts, lighting conditions, and perspectives. Furthermore, they are commonly used in AI-generated image detection research, such as those discussed in Section \ref{background}.

We used fake images from three previous AI-generated image detection projects: CNNDetection
\citep{wang2020cnngeneratedimagessurprisinglyeasy}, DMimageDetection \citep{corvi2022detectionsyntheticimagesgenerated}, and UniversalFakeDetect
\citep{ojha2024universalfakeimagedetectors}. These datasets include a vast amount of images generated by various models and architectures, including GANs and diffusion models, among others.

\subsection{Data Splitting}

To prepare our dataset for use, we followed the following steps.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[1.] Download approximately 4,500 images whose widths and heights are between 224 and 512 pixels, at random, from ImageNet, using a Kaggle notebook. Download the 2017 COCO test dataset using FiftyOne.
    \item[2.] Download the synthetic images test sets from CNNDetection and DMimageDetection, and the diffusion models dataset from UniversalFakeDetect.
    \item[3.] From the downloaded data, select approximately 4,500 images from COCO, 3,600 images from CNNDetection, 3,600 images from DMimageDetection, and 1,800 from UniversalFakeDetect, whose widths and heights are between 224 and 512 pixels, at random.
    \item[4.] Place the real and AI-generated images into folders \texttt{0\_real} and \texttt{1\_fake}, respectively. Zip the parent directory, upload to Google Drive, and unzip.
    \item[5.] Split the dataset into train, validation, and test splits with a 75/20/5 ratio. Save these splits on Google Drive.
\end{enumerate}

The exact sizes of our splits can be found in Table \ref{data_splits}.

\begin{table}[t]

        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Data Processing and Augmentation}

To speed up training, we pre-computed the concatenated embeddings used to train our classifier. This involved passing the input images through the pre-trained ViT-b/16 and EfficientNet-b4 models, after removing their final classification layers. As these models were pre-trained with different normalization statistics, we applied distinct transformation steps. First, images were center croped to 224x224 pixels to ensure compatibility with both models. Then, for ViT-b/16, images were normalized using a mean of [0.5, 0.5, 0.5] and a standard deviation of [0.5, 0.5, 0.5], scaling pixel values to the range [-1, 1]. For EfficientNet-b4, images were normalized using ImageNet statistics, with a mean of [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and a standard deviation of [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]. These normalization steps align with the pre-training of the respective models, ensuring optimal feature extraction. The output embeddings from ViT-b/16 (768 dimensions) and EfficientNet-b4 (1792 dimensions) were then concatenated, resulting in a 2560-dimensional vector. This processing step is applied folder-wise, images from each folder from \ref{data_splits} are saved together as an .npz file and will be later loaded using \texttt{TensorFolder} and \texttt{DataLoader} in PyTorch.

No data augmentation is applied for the training of our final model, as we have a wide variety of images in our collected dataset. But we have explored technique of applying random cropping, random rotation, and color jitering on the fly during the training other images-based architecture we have explored.

\section{Architecture}
\label{arch}

Our final model leverages a multi-expert approach, leveraging  the power of two pre-trained vision models, Vision Transformer(ViT-/b16) and EfficientNet-b4, to classify images as either real or AI-generated. Our model consists of two main parts, Transfer Learning Encoder and a Fully-Connected Classifier with a total of 104,659,017 parameters. As this is a large amount og weights, we  freeze the pre-trained parameters in the two pre-trained models and only train the 1,311,745 parameters in the classifier part.

\subsection{Transfer Learning Encoder}

Our Encoder takes in images of 224 * 224, and uses separate mean and variance values suggested by Vision Transformer and EfficientNet to normalize the images separately.  We removed the original classifiers of the two model and froze their pretrained weights. Normalized images are then passed into the two pretrained models, and ViT-b/16 and EfficientNet-b4 output feature embeddings of size of 768 and 1792 respectively. And we concatenate the embeddings to further pass into our classifier.

We selected ViT-b/16 and EfficientNet-b4 due to their distinct architectural strengths, enabling them to capture complementary feature representations. ViT's transformer-based architecture excels at modeling global semantic relationships, while EfficientNet's CNN-based design is adept at extracting local textural and structural details. This diversity of feature extraction is helpful for detecting a different kinds of anomalies in AI-generated images, from semantic inconsistencies to subtle textural and structural artifacts

\subsection{Fully-Connected Classifier}

The concatenated embedding vector is passed through a two layer classification network consisting of the following layers:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[1.]Linear Layer (2560 $\rightarrow$ 512): Projects the input to a 512-dimensional hidden space.
    \item[2.]ReLU Activation: Introduces non-linearity.
    \item[3.]Dropout (p=0.5): Regularizes the network and prevents overfitting.
    \item[4.]Linear Layer (512 $\rightarrow$ 1): Projects the features to a single output neuron, representing the logit for binary classification.
\end{enumerate}
Our network focus on training the 1,311,745 trainable parameters in this classifier.


\subsection{Training Details}
\begin {enumerate}
\item[1.]As Vision Transformer's attention mechanism is extremely computationally expensive, we pre-computed embeddings from the training dataset to significantly speed up training and reduce computational resources.
\item[2.]Loss Function: BCEWithLogitsLoss.
\item[3.]Optimizer: Adam Optimizer with weight decay of 0.005.
\item[4.]Training is performed for 30 epochs with a batch size of 32 and a learning rate of 0.001
\end{enumerate}

\section{Baseline Model}

For our baseline model, we wrote a CNN inspired by \citet{wang2020cnngeneratedimagessurprisinglyeasy}, which is roughly illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:baseline_arch}. It has seven convolutional layers and a total of $1,195,009$ parameters. Between each layer, we applied ReLU and batch normalization. We used a batch size of 64, a learning rate of 0.01, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum 0.9, and a binary cross-entropy loss function. We trained over 17 epochs.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{center}

    \end{center}
    \caption{Baseline model architecture, simplified; the final fully connected layer to a single output neuron.}
    \label{fig:baseline_arch}
\end{figure}

Across various hyperparameter combinations, we observed wide oscillations in our validation curves and overfitting. This is most likely due to the complex nature of the task, which demands greater parameters and epochs than ours. In our best model we were able to achieve a validation accuracy of 67.0\% and a testing accuracy of 65.6\%.

\section{Quantitative Results}
The EffVit Model achieved a final test accuracy of 85.9\% which is an essential indicator of success. The training and validation performance is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Training_Curves}. As observed, the train and validation losses decrease almost simultaneously with roughly the same value throughout the 30 training epochs. Both loss begins to plateau around epoch 20 where the train and validation loss reaches 0.2938 and 0.2911 respectively at the end. The train and validation accuracies reaches 87.79\% and 87.29\% respectively. This suggests EffVit is learning the patterns of the embeddings of AI-generated images without over and underfitting. Detailed statistics of the model can be seen in Table \ref{tab:metrics} which will be further analyzed in the Discussion section.

        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}



\section{Qualitative Results}
Quantitative results from the last section suggests decent performance of EffVit Model on determining AI-generated images. In the real world, fake images generated by a variety of architectures and models will observe contrasting high and low level features. To evaluate how well the model generalizes on images created by different models, six AI-generated images created by distinct models are selected from the test dataset. These images are then passed through the EffVit Model to obtain the output confidence levels.

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:Conf}, it is observed that EffVit Model's confidence levels on images generated by GAN based models (CycleGAN, BigGAN, ProGAN) are relatively high. On the other hand, EffVit's confidence levels on images generated by Diffusion based models and transformer based models (GuidedDiffusion, Glide, Dalle-E Mini) are relatively low. EffVit may be learning subtle artifacts that images generated by GAN-based models have in common. This leads to high confidence on GAN generated images and lower confidence on images that don't contain those artifacts. The model's biased performance may be caused by an unbalanced training dataset containing more GAN-based images than diffusion and transformer based images.

\section{Performance on New Data}

\subsection{Data}

We evaluated our model on three sets of new data: real images from Caltech 256 \citep{griffinholubperona2022}, GAN-generated images from \citet{chuangchuangtanGANGenDetection}, and images generated by diffusion models from \citet{stable-diffusion-100k-custom-prompts-and-images}.

Caltech 256 was chosen for two reasons. First, there were enough images in the set that cropping to 224x224 would not remove too much of the image. Many other datasets with a range of semantics that we considered, for example Open Images \citep{Kuznetsova_2020}, do not contain images small enough for our model. Second, the images in Caltech 256 are very often edited. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:coco_vs_caltech}, many have their background removed, which marks a stark contrast from ImageNet and COCO, where objects are almost always in context. This is more representative of images on the internet, which are often edited, and allows us to evaluate our model for more general use.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figs/coco_laptop.jpg}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{figs/caltech_laptop.jpg}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Laptops in context, from COCO (left), and a laptop with no background, from Caltech 256 (right).}
    \label{fig:coco_vs_caltech}
\end{figure}

We used two datasets for AI-generated images because we wanted to evaluate the performance of our model on the two main types of architectures our model was trained on: GANs and diffusion models.

From these datasets, we used 984 real images, and $1,018$ fake images, selected at random.

\subsection{Evaluation}

On the new data, our model achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, and similar precision and recall scores. However, it is much better at identifying images generated by GANs than diffusion models. When only evaluating the GAN-generated dataset, its accuracy is 83.0\%, and when only evaluating the diffusion-model-generated dataset, its accuracy is 59.5\%. This is illustrated in the t-SNE of the hidden activations on the data shown in Figure \ref{fig:new_data_tsne}. We can see that the embeddings of most GAN-generated images form a cluster on the right, whereas most diffusion-model-generated image embeddings are spread throughout the large cluster of mostly real images on the left. However, there is a small cluster of diffusion-model-generated image embeddings at around $(25, -15)$, suggesting the model has learned something about this class of AI-generated images.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.34]{figs/tsne.png}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.34]{figs/tsne-vit.png}

    \end{center}
    \caption{t-SNE of final model's hidden activations on new dataset, by data type (left), with EffNet neurons zeroed (middle), and with ViT neurons zeroed (right).}
    \label{fig:new_data_tsne}
\end{figure}

Due to the challenging nature of our data as described above, the achievement of our model exceeds our expectations. However, as mentioned in Section \ref{discussion}, we most likely could have improved our model's accuracy on images generated by diffusion models by using training data that was more balanced, relative to images generated by GANs.

\section{Discussion}
\label{discussion}

In our Project Proposal, we presented a somewhat novel zero-shot model for detecting AI-generated images, which involved two steps. The first was a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) which was trained to encode and then reconstruct real images only. Then, it was frozen and given real and AI-generated images, and its pixel-wise reconstruction loss was given to a CNN binary classifier. We were able to train the CAE to a relatively low error, but it performed equally well on both real and fake images, and the classifier performed randomly. Next, we tried replacing the CAE's encoder with a transfer learning model, but again, our classifier gave random predictions. In contrast, the input to EffVit's classifier is the non-decoded embedding. We have learned two things from this: first, that vanilla autoencoders cannot capture the subtle differences between real and fake images, and second, it is the decoder in particular that obfuscates these differences. The output of the decoder is much less useful for this task than the embedding itself.

However, not all embeddings are equal. As mentioned in Section \ref{arch}, ViT and EffNet give us more global and local information, respectively. Figure \ref{fig:new_data_tsne} shows the output of our model's hidden layer, as well as the outputs of that layer, using input neurons from each of ViT and EffNet only. From it, we can make two observations. First, ViT is much better at identifying images from diffusion-based models than EffNet, which essentially cannot tell the difference between them and real images. Second, ViT is much more useful overall; the output of the hidden layer is almost identical to the output of that layer with the EffNet neurons zeroed out. This suggests that our model has learned to discard most of the information EffNet gives it, which implies that global information is much more useful in this problem, especially in identifying diffusion-generated images. Therefore, we speculate that center cropping our images may have removed key information that is needed for this problem.

Other than poor performance on diffusion models, our model's biggest limitation is that its training data does not adequately represent images found ``in the wild''. Images on the internet are often heavily compressed or edited, and our dataset, and especially our synthetic images, do not reflect this reality. Future work should not only use data that is more balanced between synthesis architectures, but also should use data augmentation techniques that represent ``the wild''. These techniques would involve applying lossy compression, such as JPEG, WebP, and HEIF compression, one or more times.

\section{Ethical Considerations}
\subsection{Adversarial Attacks}
AI-generated images could be modified to evade detection through techniques like JPEG compression or adversarial noise injection. To counter this, future iterations should integrate \textbf{adversarial training} and preprocessing steps such as JPEG artifact analysis. For example, compressing images to 80\% quality before inference could help identify synthetic content resistant to compression.

\subsection{Data Bias and Limitations}
Our training data overrepresented GAN-generated images (e.g., CycleGAN, StyleGAN), leading to weaker performance on diffusion models (59.5\% accuracy vs. 83\% for GANs). This bias could skew real-world deployment, favoring legacy generators over newer architectures like latent diffusion models. To mitigate this, datasets must be rebalanced with synthetic images from diverse generators.

\subsection{Misuse and Privacy}
False positives (e.g., misclassifying edited real images as synthetic) could harm creators' reputations. We explicitly disclose the model’s limitations (e.g., lower accuracy on diffusion models) and advocate for its use as an \textbf{assistive tool}, not definitive proof. Additionally, while we used public datasets (ImageNet, COCO), real-world deployment requires protocols to avoid inadvertent use of private or sensitive content.


\section{Project Difficulty}

This project addressed an \textbf{exceptionally challenging task}—detecting AI-generated images in a landscape where generative models evolve faster than detection tools. The difficulty ranged far greater than what is normally observed in the labs. As mentioned in the Discussion section, the team started with Zero shot detection method, onto the 
an alternative transfer learning apprach as mentioned in the Progress Report, but due to the challenging nature of the project, it failed to do well on new datasets. This presented a challenge for the team, wherein we had to begin the project with a new perspective. The final model presented is an amalgamation of two uniquely chosen transfer learning models, such that both global semantic relationships and local textural details be accomodated, which further is passed through a fully connected classifier to give the final probability of an image to be AI-generated (See Architecture Section).

Due to the ever evolving nature of the data available to use for such a model, the team faced several data sourcing issues, which had to be combatted in a timely manner considering the timeline of the project. Parsing 13,500+ real images from COCO/ImageNet, along with 9000+ fake images from GAN and Diffusion models required high precision data cleaning and classifiying protocols to be followed so that the model picks up the data easily. A lot of time and energy was spent making sure the data set is balanced compliying to ethical priniciples laid down in our Project Proposal.
Due to the high amounts of data used for training, testing and validation datasets, this required high memory usage, and necessity for Google Collab Pro and A100 GPUs, as T4 GPUs simply can't handle the model with this size. This presented computational requirement challenges that the team combatted with perseverence.
In total, the team went through 4-5 intermediate models to finally derive the final model.

No current approach in the market at the moment demonstrates robust generalization to unseen AI architectures (citation), thus the project tries to aid in the unsolved research problem. We claim that despite the challenging nature of the project, the final model does exceptionally well when compared to industry standards.
Beginning with the Baseline Model (mentioned in Section-), the model outperforms baseline model accuracy of 65.6\% with it's 85.9\% accuracy as seen in Table 2 (reference). Eveen when tested on new data, Synthlens outperforms the baseline model by around 10\%.
Furthermore, state-of-the art for profit models like Sightengine attain an accuracy of 81\% (See Section Background), our model underforms this by only a mere 5\% margin attesting that our model performs exceptionally well as per the standards of an undergraduate engineering project.
