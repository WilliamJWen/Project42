\section{Introduction}



\section{Illustration / Figure}



\section{Background \& Related Work}

Image synthesis is the process wherein an artificial image is generated by a computer from an input prompt, which may be text or some other form of media. This field exploded after the creation of GANs in 2014, a deep learning architecture particularly adept at generating photorealistic images \citep{GANfather}. More recently, DMs have also been a popular choice for image synthesis \citep{latent-diffusion}. While many attempts have been made to develop programs that can detect images generated by these architectures, they continually evolve to outsmart old detectors.

\subsection{Sightengine}

There are a number of AI-generated image detection websites which are free to use. One of these is \citet{sightengine}, which has a high accuracy rate compared to many other websites: approximately 99\% on real images and 81\% on AI-generated ones \citep{li2024adversarialaiartunderstandinggeneration}. However, it is far from foolproof. For example, when tested on images generated from image prompts by Dream Studio and DALL-E, its accuracy falls to only 34\%. As opposed to images generated from text prompts, images generated from real image prompts may be more challenging to detect, since they are more likely to be very similar to the real images they were generated from.

Many free websites like sightengine also predict the source of AI-generated images among many commonly-used synthesis models. Although the accuracy of this feature has not been formally investigated, it seems to fail often.

Though sightengine has not published its methods for AI-generated image detection, there are a number of open-source detectors available online, some of which are discussed below.

\subsection{Beyond the Spectrum}

Many earlier attempts at AI-generated image detection focused on GAN-generated images, since using DMs for image synthesis only began in 2022. One of these is Beyond the Spectrum (BtS), an open-source project \citep{he2021spectrumdetectingdeepfakesresynthesis}.

Its method for detection involves two stages. First, a re-synthesizer is trained, only on real images, to reconstruct images from their downsampled versions. Next, this re-synthesizer is given both real and fake images, and the reconstruction error (which is assumed to be greater for GAN-generated images) is given to a classifier to predict whether a given image is real or not.

In 2021, BtS achieved approxiately 90\% accuracy on its testing datasets and was state-of-the-art (SoTA). However, in 2024, after the progression of GAN models and the advent of DMs, BtS achieves only a 21\% accuracy rate \citep{li2024adversarialaiartunderstandinggeneration}. Nonetheless, its approach is echoed in more recent successful approaches, such as the zero-shot method discussed in \ref{ZED}.

\subsection{Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining}

Another architecture that has been explored for detecting AI-generated images is Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining (CLIP), which was developed by OpenAI in 2021 \citep{radford2021learningtransferablevisualmodels}. This model is trained on pairs of images and text, and in the context of AI-generated image detection, this text might either be their prompts or human-written descriptions. CLIP was used to achieve an accuracy of 95-100\%, making it a promising model for AI-generated image detection \citep{moskowitz2024detectingaigeneratedimagesclip}.

\subsection{Vision Transformers}

In natural language processing, text is interpreted as a sequence of tokens from which subsequent tokens can be predicted. Vision transformers (ViT) take a similar approach. Images are broken down into non-overlapping sections, like tokens, which are sent into an encoder comprised of multi-head attention and feed-forward neural networks. The output of the encoder is then passed into an MLP which classifies the image; in our case, it predicts whether the image is real or fake. In April 2024, researchers combined CLIP and ViT (CLIP-ViT) and were able to outperform a number of SoTA detection methods with an average accuracy of 90\% \citep{cozzolino2024raisingbaraigeneratedimage}.

\subsection{Zero-Shot Entropy-Based Detector}
\label{ZED}

The main issue in designing AI-generated image detectors is that image synthesis models are constantly evolving to circumvent detectors trained on old data. In September 2024, a new zero-shot method was devised which initally only trains on real images \citep{cozzolino2024zeroshotdetectionaigeneratedimages}. First, a CNN is trained to predict real images from encoded versions of those images. Next, the CNN is used to predict both real and fake images from their encoded versions, and loss statistics used to differentiate real images from synthetic ones. Higher loss generally corresponds to AI-generated images, since the CNN provides a good model for real images.

This method was able to achieve an accuracy of 90\%, better than many other SoTA models.

\section{Architecture}



\section{Baseline Model}

For our baseline model, we wrote a CNN inspired by \citet{wang2020cnngeneratedimagessurprisinglyeasy}, which is roughly illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:baseline_arch}. It has seven convolutional layers and a total of $1,195,009$ parameters. Between each layer, we applied ReLU and batch normalization. We used a batch size of 64, a learning rate of 0.01, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum 0.9, and a binary cross-entropy loss function. We wanted to train over $3,000$ iterations, which corresponded to 17 epochs.

    \end{center}
    \caption{Baseline model architecture, simplified; the final fully connected layer to a single output neuron.}
    \label{fig:baseline_arch}
\end{figure}

Across various hyperparameter combinations, we observed that validation curves were quite jagged, though they declined with the training curve (see Figure \ref{fig:baseline_curves}). The model learns the training data slowly, yet struggles to generalize. This is most likely due to the complex nature of the task, which demands greater parameters and epochs than ours. In our best model we were able to achieve a validation accuracy of 67.0\% and a testing accuracy of 65.6\%. Detailed classification statistics for each split can be seen in Table \ref{baseline_stats}.
